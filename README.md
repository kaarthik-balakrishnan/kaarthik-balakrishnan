# 👋 Hello, I’m Kaarthik Abhinav Balakrishnan

I'm a PhD candidate in **Interdisciplinary Biophysics** at The Ohio State University, working at the intersection of **computational neuroscience**, **machine learning**, and **biological systems**.

My research focuses on understanding how internal brain states influence behavior—particularly thermoregulatory strategies in larval zebrafish—using **neural imaging**, **statistical modeling**, and **machine learning**.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- 🐟 **Thermal navigation in ectotherms**  
  Using behavioral assays + Markov models to uncover internal states underlying temperature-based navigation (https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.17.643749)

- 🧬 **Neural activity to behavior mapping**  
  Built a general machine learning method to relate functional imaging data to behavioral patterns. [Published in *eLife*, 2023](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.83289)

- 🧪 **In-vivo functional imaging**  
  Two-photon calcium imaging of zebrafish to analyze circuit-level computation.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech

- **Languages:** Python, MATLAB, C++, LaTeX, FORTRAN  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **ML:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, STAN, HMMs, GLMs  
- **Experimentation:** Two-photon microscopy, behavioral tracking

---

## 🧭 Research Philosophy

I’m passionate about using **data-driven approaches to understand the brain**, and applying those insights to domains like **brain-computer interfaces** and **AI-enhanced healthcare**.

> 🧩 "Brains are nature’s most elegant problem solvers. I try to reverse-engineer that elegance."
